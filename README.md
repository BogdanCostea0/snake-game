# snake-game

snake game built in python 

you can control the snake by using the keyboard arrows.

the score increases every time you touch the food

game-over conditions:
  - - you touch the wall
  - - you touch yourself
   
this game is for educational purposes only.
I coded it to practice working with classes, inheritance, slicing and many other things.
